# Project Name

Restaurant Project Server

## Description

This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, featuring authentication with Passport.js. The server handles user data, restaurant details, and comments, enabling secure user authentication and data management.

Key Features are:

1. User Authentication: Secure login and registration using Passport.js.
2. MongoDB Integration: Stores user data, restaurant details, and comments.
3. RESTful API: Provides endpoints for users, restaurants, and comments.

## Installation

Accessing the MongoDB will require the key. You won't get it, so don't install the project.

(Note for myself: use "npm run build" command to deploy to netlify)
